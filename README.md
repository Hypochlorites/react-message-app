## Overview 
Updated version of an old project that I used to learn react. This project aims to be more clean and functional, as the old project has a lot of garbage code in it. Still just a project being used to learn react, but should be more functional. Will be connected to a firebase databse to manage the users, dialogues, and authentication. Uses tailwind for styling. 

### Current State
Foundation that is setup. Is connected to a firebase database for authentication. A state variable has the website itself be affected by the user's login status. Website itself has basic functionality with a navbar and a couple of pages.
