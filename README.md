## Overview 
Updated version of an old project that I used to learn react. This project aims to be more clean and functional, as the old project has a lot of garbage code in it. Still just a project being used to learn react, but should be more functional. Connected to a firebase databse to manage the users, dialogues, and authentication. Uses tailwind for styling. 

### Current State
Foundation that is setup. Is connected to a firebase database for authentication, and the storage of users, chats, and messages. Various state variables are used to have the website affected by these database elements. Website itself has basic functionality with a navbar and a couple of pages.
