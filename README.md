## Overview 
Updated version of an old project that I used to learn react. This project aims to be more clean and functional, as the old project has a lot of garbage code in it. Still just a project being used to learn react, but should be more functional. Will be connected to a firebase databse to manage the users, dialogues, and authentication. Uses tailwind for styling. 

### Current State
Very basic build that is just a foundation to be built on. Has tailwind set up, a navbar, and a couple pages. Yet to be connected to a database.
